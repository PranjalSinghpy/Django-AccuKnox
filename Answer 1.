Yes, Django signals are executed synchronously. That means when a signal is sent, all the connected receivers run immediately in the same thread one by one before the execution continues.
import time
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

@receiver(post_save, sender=Student)
def student_saved(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received")
    time.sleep(5) 
    print("Signal executed")

If we run a test case:

from myapp.models import Student
import time
start = time.time()
Student.objects.create(name="Roni", age=25)
end = time.time()
print("Total time:", end - start)

Output will be:
Signal received
(wait 5 sec...)
signal executed
Total time: ~5.0 seconds
